    <h1>What are Heroes?</h1>
      <p>Heroes are playable characters with Overwatch that are also from lore.
         These characters can range from a cyborg ninja to a hamster on a wrecking ball.
         This wide variety of heroes can make the selection of what hero to play a difficult feat in their first match.
         The table below will briefly explain each character categorized by the class they are in.</p>

            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>D. Va is a mobile tank who works strongly in teams who move quickly. She is able to move around the terrain
              with ease. When the mech runs out of health, she pops out of the mech and can shoot her pistol to build up ult charge.
              Once she activates her ult out of her mech, she can resummon the mech at full health to continue fighting.</td>

            <td>Orisa is mechanical horse who is the anchor for a team. Using her shield and crowd control abilities, she can manipulate incoming
              damage as well as the enemies themselves. Unlike other tanks, she is best played at medium range where her rapid fire weapon
              is most succesful.</td>

            <td>Reinhardt is a large target but he is also a huge anchor to a team. Using his huge shield, he can block a ton of bullets,
              save his team from enemy ultimates, and help hold a point. He uses a big hammer to melee hit the enemy.
              The downside to using him though is that he has no resistance to crowd control abilities.</td>

            <td>Roadhog is a tank that specializes in burst, close distance damage. He uses a scrap cannon that is similar to a shotgun.
              He has two abilities. The first is take a breather which allows Roadhog to heal himself and reduce damage taken during the time he uses the ability.
              The second ability is a hook that pulls a target in from of him to make them an easy target to eliminate.</td>

            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>Winston is a smart, talking gorilla from outer space. He is similar to D. Va in that he is mobile and should go after smaller targets using their
              mobility. Winston is able to use the jetpack on his back to propel himself into the air and shield in the shape of a bubble he can deploy.
              He is a close range tank as his weapon is a tesla that has a very small range.</td>

            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>Wrecking ball is a big metal wercking ball with a hamster named Hammond in it. This tank is very mobile and is mainly a area denial/control
              tank. His guns are better at close range but can be used at medium to long range and Wrecking Ball uses a grappling hook to swing around. Once
              he has reached a certain speed, rolling into enemies will do damage.</td>

            <td>Zarya is a tank that excells at close range. She is able to place a bubble that protect herself and a bubble that can protect a teammate.
              They break after a certain amount of damage and only stay for a short amount of time. If an enemy hits the bubble, Zarya will gain charge which
              makes the beam coming from her weapon do more damage.</td>
