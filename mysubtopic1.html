    <h1>What are Heroes?</h1>
      <p>Heroes are playable characters with Overwatch that are also from lore.
         These characters can range from a cyborg ninja to a hamster on a wrecking ball.
         This wide variety of heroes can make the selection of what hero to play a difficult feat in their first match.
         The table below will briefly explain each character categorized by the class they are in.</p>
    <h3>The Heroes</h3>

            <td><img src="../problem-set-3/images/Dva.png" height="50px" width="50px">D. Va</td>
            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>D. Va is a mobile tank who works strongly in teams who move quickly. She is able to move around the terrain
              with ease. When the mech runs out of health, she pops out of the mech and can shoot her pistol to build up ult charge.
              Once she activates her ult out of her mech, she can resummon the mech at full health to continue fighting.</td>

            <td><img src="../problem-set-3/images/Orisa.png" height="60px" width="75px">Orisa</td>
            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>Orisa is mechanical horse who is the anchor for a team. Using her shield and crowd control abilities, she can manipulate incoming
              damage as well as the enemies themselves. Unlike other tanks, she is best played at medium range where her rapid fire weapon
              is most succesful.</td>

            <td><img src="../problem-set-3/images/Rein.png" height="50px" width="50px">Reinhardt</td>
            <td>Tank</td>
            <td>Reinhardt is a large target but he is also a huge anchor to a team. Using his huge shield, he can block a ton of bullets,
              save his team from enemy ultimates, and help hold a point. He uses a big hammer to melee hit the enemy.
              The downside to using him though is that he has no resistance to crowd control abilities.</td>
